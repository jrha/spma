	  upgrade support)
	
        * Added configuration file handling for SPMA, and
	  default (void) config file.

	* Policy change: do not allow users to mark SPMA packages as
	UNWANTED (by deleting them manually between SPMA runs). It makes
	the code more complex and error recovery is much more
	difficult. Thus, these packages will be marked as 'non existing'
	and will be reinstalled by the SPMA if they are on the target
	configuration.

	* Improved signal handler.
